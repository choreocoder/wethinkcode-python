# 👋 Welcome!

Hey there! This repository tracks my journey through **Harvard's CS50: Introduction to Programming with Python**.  
Here, I share solutions, weekly highlights, and reflections as I build my Python foundation.

## 🚀 Why I’m Doing CS50

This course is part of the pre-curriculum for my journey toward **WeThinkCode_**.  
It’s helping me **think like a programmer**, build confidence in Python, and prepare for more advanced concepts down the line.

---

## 💡 Highlights So Far

- Using **pseudocode and journaling** to plan solutions — it really helps me articulate my thought process.  
- **Critical thinking is improving**: I can separate concerns and stack code logically.  
- Learning to **synthesize concepts** — combining loops, input validation, and exceptions.  
- **Coding defensively**: writing code that doesn’t just work, but runs reliably.

---

## 🤔 Reflections

Python is teaching me **clarity and precision**.  
I’ve realized frustration often comes from expecting my code to do things I haven’t explicitly told it to do.  
This journey has emphasized the **order of operations**: understanding what to do first, why, and how my program executes step by step.  

I’m learning that programming isn’t just about making something work — it’s about making something **work well, safely, and thoughtfully**.

## 🔭 Next Steps

- Complete **Week 6 – File I/O** exercises.  
- Begin **Week 7 – Functions & Modules**.  
- Continue applying **defensive coding** techniques.  
- Update this README weekly with **highlights, reflections, and insights**.

*Every week, I try to leave a breadcrumb of what I’ve learned, so I can look back and see my growth. This is both a portfolio and a personal journal.*
