👋 Welcome!

Hey there! This repository tracks my journey through Harvard's CS50: Introduction to Programming with Python.
Here, I share solutions, weekly highlights, and reflections as I build my Python foundation.

🗂️ Weeks Completed

✅ Week 0 – Functions & Variables

✅ Week 1 – Conditionals

✅ Week 2 – Loops

✅ Week 3 – Exceptions

✅ Week 4 – Libraries

✅ Week 5 – Unit Testing

✅ Week 6 – File I/O

🚧 Week 7 – Regular Expressions (In Progress)

(Weekly chapters and solutions are updated here as I progress.)


🚀 Why I’m Doing CS50

This course is part of the pre-curriculum for WeThinkCode_.
It’s helping me think like a programmer, build confidence in Python, and prepare for more advanced concepts.

💡 Highlights So Far

Using pseudocode and journaling to plan solutions.

Improving critical thinking: separating concerns and stacking code logically.

Learning to synthesize concepts — combining loops, input validation, and exceptions.

Practicing defensive coding to write reliable programs.

Exploring creative problem-solving — finding uncommon but effective solutions.

🤔 Reflections

Python is teaching me clarity and precision.
Frustration often comes from expecting code to do things I haven’t explicitly told it to do.
I’m learning to consider the order of operations: what to do first, why, and how programs execute step by step.

Solving one problem often uncovers another — challenging me to think more defensively, stay flexible, and avoid complacency.
Programming isn’t just about making something work — it’s about making it work well, safely, and thoughtfully.

🔭 Next Steps

Complete Week 8 – Regular Expressions exercises.

Continue applying defensive coding techniques and exploring theoretical concepts.

Build on CS50 foundations to prepare for WeThinkCode_ projects starting mid-September.

Update this README weekly with highlights, reflections, and insights.

Every week, I leave a breadcrumb of what I’ve learned — a mix of portfolio and personal journal to track my growth.
