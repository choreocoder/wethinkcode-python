🚀 Why I Took CS50

This course is a prerequisite and part of the pre-curriculum for my software engineering journey at WeThinkCode_.
It’s helping me build a solid foundation in Python before diving deeper into more advanced programming concepts.

💡 Highlights So Far

I’m learning to articulate my thoughts using pseudocode and journaling, which helps me plan solutions more effectively.

My critical thinking has improved — I’m better at separating concerns when needed and stacking code logically.

Over the past few weeks, I’ve been synthesizing sections of my work, combining loops with input validation and more.

I’m beginning to code defensively, prioritizing writing code that runs reliably rather than just code that works.

🤔 Reflections

After a few weeks, this journey has been refreshing. I’m discovering that Python is a language of clarity and logic. When I feel frustrated, I remind myself that I might be expecting my program to do something I haven’t explicitly told it to do. Python has taught me the importance of clarity and specificity. Most importantly, I’m learning the order of operations — understanding what to do first, why, and how my program runs step by step.
