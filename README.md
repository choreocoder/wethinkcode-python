🚀 Why I Took CS50

This course is a prerequisite and part of the pre-curriculum for my software engineering journey at WeThinkCode_.
It’s helping me build a solid foundation in Python before diving deeper into more advanced programming concepts.

💡 Highlights So Far

I'm learning to articulate myself using pseudo-code and journalling. It helps me plan my solutions better.

I am learning that it is not enough for the code to run, it need to run smoothly. Small hiccups become bigger ones later.

I am beginning to code defensively - thinking of potential bugging issues ahead of time.


🤔 Reflections

Lately, I’ve been noticing how much of life is algorithmic — even making a breakfast sandwich involves a series of logical steps:
take out crockery → place bread on plate → smear butter → combine slices → enjoy.

This course has made me more conscious of the processes I follow — in life and in programming. It’s challenging me to be more intentional, more precise, and more effective at problem-solving — whether it’s for a good breakfast or a complex application.
